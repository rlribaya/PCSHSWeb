                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
                    Pasig City Science High School (PCSHS) was established on October 7, 2004, through the unwavering support and determination of former Mayor Soledad C. Eusebio, Hon. Mayor Vicente P. Eusebio, and the members of the City Council. It was founded under City Ordinance No. 28, series 2004, and proudly carries the name Pasig City Science High School.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pasig City Science High School initially operated at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig for a year before relocating to its dedicated building near the Rainforest Park in Maybunga. Mr. Noel Salalima served as the school's first principal, overseeing its operations until 2013. He was succeeded by Mr. Jay Mathias Arellano, who held the position from the academic year 2014 until June 2018.<br>
                    <br>
                    In December 2013, a significant milestone was reached as the school inaugurated a new six-story building, which was ceremonially opened by then-mayor Ms. Maribel Andaya Eusebio and the City Council. The building was first utilized by the Grade 7 students during the academic year 2014–2015. This expansion further facilitated the growth and development of Pasig City Science High School, providing additional facilities to support the academic pursuits of its students.<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, PCSHS is led by Mr. Charlie O. Fababaer, a homegrown school leader, who diligently upholds the school's mission and vision. Under his guidance, the school aims to develop well-rounded, nurturing, and excellent students who are globally competitive and responsive to the ever-changing demands of Science and Technology.<br>

                <h2>SCHOOL LOGO</h2>
                <p>
                    The Pasig City Science High School logo was crafted with careful consideration to represent the school's commitment to holistic education and development. <br>
                    <br>
                    The circular design signifies the school's dedication to nurturing well-rounded students in the fields of science, mathematics, and technology, shaping them to become future leaders. <br>
                    <br>
                    The torch at the center symbolizes the passion for knowledge shared by the administrators, teachers, and students, who strive for continuous learning and the transmission of fresh ideas and information.<br>
                    <br>
                    The open book represents the endless pursuit of knowledge, always open for exploration and enlightenment.   <br>
                    <br>
                    The star symbolizes the exceptional quality of the school's curriculum, services, staff, and facilities. It represents the outstanding professional and personal qualities of the administration, faculty, and support staff.<br>
                    <br>
                    The sun in the logo represents the school's mission, vision, and highest ideals. The eight rays symbolize the collective efforts of entities like the Department of Education, Office of the Mayor, City Council, Education Unit, School Administration, School Faculty, School Support Staff, and Parents'-Teachers' Association (PTA). These entities work together harmoniously to provide the best quality education to the students of PCSHS.<br>
